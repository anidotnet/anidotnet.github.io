  This is my personal blog. Here I'll be sharing my day-to-day experience as a programmer.
  I am a Java developer by profession, but constantly fiddle with other technologies like
  .Net/C#, Google Golang, HTML5/CSS/JS as well.

  Most of the stuff here will be code snippets or a brief article about the stuff I play with.
  I'll be more than happy and grateful if any of these will ever come in useful to anyone.
