description: A tutorial on how to create a personal blog using Github.

For the obvious reason this has to be my very first blog entry. When I decided to have my own blog up and running, I had to choose from several options like Wordpress, Blogger, Tumblr and many more. After a little experiment, in the end I chose Github pages; yes [Github](https://pages.github.com/)! You heard it right. For those who don't know it yet Github is an excellent place to host your own blog. Not only it is completely free, it gives you ultimate control over your blog unlike other blog engines.

The advantages you get in Github over other blog engines are like:

- Ultimate control over design
- Plethora of free templates
- Custom domain names
- Unlimited storage space in Github and many more.


[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) a static site generator  will create your blog from plain text. You can even setup jekyll in your local system and preview your blog before publishing it to the web.
